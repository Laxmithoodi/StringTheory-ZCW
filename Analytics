Aggregates: are functions that allow you to run a fucntion down a column rather than on
each particular row. some of these include
COUNT
MAX
MIN
SUM

COUNT- gives you total number of rows in a table based on column
SELECT COUNT(*)  as "count"
FROM teachers;
COUNT/3
Count doesnot consider the values in any column. Simpl add one for each row.

MAX/MIN - gives you larges or smallest value of a column in any row.
SELECT MAX(years) as "max" MIN(years) as "min"
FROM zipcode.teachers_meta;
max- 11
min - 4
these will consider data type when doing this sort.
Text will sort lexographically and numbers will sor numerically.

mysql -u root  - to preform operations from terminal

SUM- take value of a numeric column and add all the values together
SELECT SUM(years) as "sum"
FROM zipcode.teachers_meta;

GROUP CONCAT - take a column and concatenates all the rows
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(' ', first_name, ' ', last_name) as "group_concant"
FROM zipcode.teachers

GROUP BY-

HAVING -
SELECT s.name, COUNT(a_s.assignment_id) as "assignemnt_given"
FROM zipcode_students s
JOIN zipcode.assignment_student a_s
    ON s.id = a_s.student_id
GROUP BY s.name
HAVING COUNT();
